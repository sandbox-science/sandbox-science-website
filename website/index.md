# 🌱 Welcome to Sandbox Science

**Sandbox Science** is a collaborative playground for programmers of all backgrounds (students, professionals, and passionate tinkerers) to explore, experiment, and grow together.

The mission is simple: **build real projects while learning real skills.**
Whether you’re learning systems programming, exploring algorithms, or prototyping creative tools, this space is designed to encourage hands-on learning and community-driven development.
