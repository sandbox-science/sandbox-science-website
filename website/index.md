# ðŸŒ± Welcome to Sandbox Science

**Sandbox Science** is where programmers of all backgrounds come together to build real things. Whether you're a student looking to apply classroom concepts, a professional exploring new domains, or someone who codes for the love of it, this is your space to experiment and grow.

The mission is simple: **build real projects while learning real skills**.
Whether youâ€™re learning systems programming, exploring algorithms, or prototyping creative tools, this space is designed to encourage hands-on learning and community-driven development.
